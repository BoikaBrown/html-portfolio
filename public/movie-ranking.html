<h1>The Best Movies According to Palesa</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies in 2024 thus far</h2>

<h3>1.The Bee Keeper</h3>
<h4>Apart from being an absolute Jason Statham fan, the film was well thought out and excellently executed with precision.70% of the movie had adrenaline rushing through my veins, and it exactly what I like my movies to do, less talk and more action.The emotionally attached element was the best part for me, shows that there are grey areas in life we tend to not take notice of, some people do bad for the greater good</h4>
<h3>2.Aquaman And The Lost Kingdom</h3>
<h4>"Power is powerless without purpose"_Me. The one thing that stood out for me in this movie is how the characters' powers were so limited when they were acting without a clear purpose or intention. Whether be it the intention to avenge, to protect or to amend. Powers are stronger when paired with purpose.</h4>
<h3>3.LIFT</h3>
<h4>It was a fun watch, Although it was very predictable</h4>
